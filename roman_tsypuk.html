Welcome to my blog where Iâ€™m sharing my experiences and insights as an engineer who is passionate about AWS Cloud, programming languages, DevOps, Architecture. Credly account to verify Certifications: https://www.credly.com/users/roman-tsypuk As a technologist, I am constantly learning and exploring new ways to improve the performance, scalability and security of software systems. I value certificatyion not only as an achievement but also as a challenge to continuously update and enhance our knowledge. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/roman-tsypuk/ Building professional connections and networking are also essential aspects of my career, and I value their importance greatly. I am always happy to connect with other professionals in the industry, especially those who share similar interests or work in related fields, so please feel free to send me a connection request on LinkedIn. Contribution to Open Source (OS): https://github.com/tsypuk I specialize in Java, Kotlin, Go and Python, and actively contribute to open-source projects. I have developed and maintain several tools designed to simplify interactions with AWS cloud. These tools address challenges in monitoring, architecture design, diagram generation, and access management, empowering AWS end-users with more efficient solutions. aws-client-monitor: tool designed to analyze applications interacting with AWS services. Itâ€™s particularly useful during local development, troubleshooting, or profiling third-party applications. Features: Real-time Monitoring: Capture and display AWS API invocations from your applications in real-time. Easy Integration: Minimal setup required; configure environment variables, and youâ€™re ready to go. Dockerized Deployment: Run the monitor effortlessly using Docker. Uses CSM mode aws-console-bar: Browser Extension (Chrome/Brave) that integrates with native AWS Console, shows latest aws news, writes stat about account sessions in your local store for analysis and history, registers pretty account naming, It enhances the AWS user experience by providing curated news topics and valuable usage statistics directly within the AWS Console interface: aws-console-bar docs multicloud_diagrams: framework that combines multiple approaches: Diagrams as a Code (Dac), resources ingestion from external yaml sources, interaction through programmatic API integration.It allows to store the Infrastructure snippet in drawio format, which is editable vector-based representation. Since source file is not a Raster form, it is easy to edit, customize, position elements based on our needs and track the history. Provided as PyPi package.
